  "About": {
    "paragraph": "Hi, my name is Maximillian Kwun-Tran. Welcome to my domain. Expressing creativity and individuality through my work is my passion. In 2020, I founded my own barbershop in San Jose, CA. While I was building the website for the shop, I discovered my affinity for software development.",
    "paragraph2": "Although the shop was thriving, I found myself on many nights pondering and exploring the wonderful world of computer science. After almost two years, I decided that I wanted to pursue a development career full time, with hopes of someday founding my own startup. In the fall of 2022, I realized my shops full potential through a successful sale, and began a new chapter.",
    "paragraph3": "Life after graduation has been nothing short of an exciting roller coaster. I have had the opportunity to meet so many amazing people along the way. I want to give a special thanks to my clients and all those who have supported me throughout my career. If you're reading this, please don't ever hesitate to reach out and connect.",
    "paragraph4": "Love always, Max",
    "paragraph5": "P.S. Got something big in development right now. See 'Shapes' in the Project section for a preview..."
